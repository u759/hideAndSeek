  - Distance calculations between teams
- **Clue Generation**: 
  - UBC-specific location database (buildings, landmarks, libraries)
  - AI-powered contextual clues based on hider locations
  - Multiple clue types with different costs
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time game state updates

### ✅ Frontend App Features
- **Game Setup**: Multi-team creation (2-6 teams)
- **Role-Based Interface**:
  - **Seekers**: Challenge drawing, token management, clue purchasing
  - **Hiders**: Automatic location sharing, hiding tips
- **Challenge Cards**: 
  - Draw random challenges/curses
  - Complete challenges for tokens
  - Veto system with penalties

## 🚀 How to Run

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
# Server runs on http://localhost:3000
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend/HideAndSeekApp
npm install
npm start
# Use Expo Go app to test on device
```

## 🎯 Game Flow

1. **Setup**: Create game with team names (first team = seekers)
2. **Hiding Phase**: Hiders get head start, location sharing begins
3. **Seeking Phase**: 
   - Seekers draw challenge cards
   - Complete challenges for tokens
   - Purchase clues about hider locations
4. **Round Rotation**: When all hiders found, roles switch

## 📱 API Endpoints Ready

- `POST /api/game` - Create new game
- `POST /api/challenges/draw` - Draw challenge card
- `POST /api/challenges/complete` - Complete challenge
- `GET /api/clues/types` - Get clue options
- `POST /api/clues/purchase` - Buy location clue
- `POST /api/location/update` - Update hider position

## 🌟 Key Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js, WebSocket
- **Frontend**: React Native, Expo, TypeScript, React Navigation
- **Location**: Expo Location API with UBC campus integration
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for live game updates

## 🎲 Challenge Integration

Your `challenges_curses.json` file is fully integrated with:
- 39 unique challenges with varying token rewards
- 8 different curses for seeker teams
- Randomized drawing system
- Token economy based on difficulty

## 🗺️ UBC-Specific Features

- Campus boundary validation (lat/lng bounds)
- UBC building and landmark database
- Context-aware clue generation
- Location-based hints for seekers

## 🔄 Real-time Features

- Live game state synchronization
